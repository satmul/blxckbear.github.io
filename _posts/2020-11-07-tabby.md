## Summary:
NMAP
Tomcat 9
LFI
WAR Reverse Shell
CURL
LXD

## Enumeration :
First step lets check the open ports with NMAP. So port 80, 22, 7001, 8080 is open, lets check them one by one.

This is the webpage from port 80

This is interesting, it said that there is user configuration. We can access tomcat webserver on this machine but the role must be manager-gui. So we must search for manager-gui credential to connect to the tomcat webserver.

I had a little trouble to find the .xml file, after spending couple of hours it turns out that i just combine the given hint on port 8080 (/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml) and it returns a blank page, check the source of the page and voila we got manager-gui credential.
